/**
 * BlockTypes have a color and implement getPointOffsets. This is used when
 * a new Block is created to initialize the block's list of points. They should not be
 * used post-initialization.
 *
 * Returns a list of 3 points that contain offset values for a given block. Each method has a
 * small comment above it that shows the 'location' of the offsets, with '=' denoting the starting
 * position of the block and with '+' denoting the location of the offsets.
 *
 * An example would be that an L block gets spawned with a starting position of (1, 1). The offsets
 * for the L block are (1, 0), (2, 0) and (3, 0). This would cause the cell positions of the L block to be
 * (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1) and (4, 1)
